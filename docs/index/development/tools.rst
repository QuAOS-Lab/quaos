.. Git:

Git
___

Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source 
code. It allows developers to collaborate on a project, manage changes, and 
revert to previous versions. More Information about Git can be found 
`here <https://git-scm.com/>`_.

.. Visual Studio Code:

Visual Studio Code
__________________

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight, powerful code editor that is 
highly customizable and widely used in the development community. With built-in 
support for debugging, Git integration, and a rich ecosystem of extensions, 
VS Code makes coding, testing, and version control more efficient.

.. note::
    While using Visual Studio Code is not mandatory, having a shared integrated 
    development environment (IDE) helps resolve common issues, improves teams
    efficiency and simplifies the development process.
    Moreover, all the other guides contained within this documentation assume 
    the use of VS Code as the IDE of choice.

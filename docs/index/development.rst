for Python code, which helps to maintain readability and consistency across the 
codebase. While not mandatory, it is recommended to follow the this coding 
standard.

In `this page <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ 
is it possible to browse the full PEP 8 style guide. 

.. note::
   The suggested PEP 8-related extensions for Visual Studio Code (see 
   `Visual Studio Code Extensions <development/extensions.html>`_), automatically
   detect PEP 8 violations highlighting them in the editor as warnings
